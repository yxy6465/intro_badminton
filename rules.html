            <h2>Goal of playing badminton</h2>
            <p>The goal of playing a badminton game is to try to hit the shuttlecock to your oppoiste court area so that your opponents are not able to hit back. The basic rule is that the shuttlecock has to be hitted over the net and does not hit to the area that is out of the court. Based on above, badminton is a sport that not only tests a player's physical abilities but also tests the player's mental abilities. In the field, a successful player needs to consider the movement of her opponents, the best spot to hit the shuttle to, the next stratedy of next rally, and so on. More information will be presented at the following sections. </p>

                <h2>Shuttlecock: feather vs. plastic</h2>
                <p>Shuttlecock, also called as shuttle/birdie, is an essential equipment in badminton. It has an open conical shape. The main components of the shuttlecock are the round cock (made of Natural rubber) and feathers. There are two types of shuttle are commonly used in the game: feather shuttle and nylon shuttle. In usual, a shuttle is a samll cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached and with weight of 5 grams. And this type of shuttle is used in official game. However, what is the main difference between these two shuttles? </p>

                    <li><em><strong>Lighter.</strong></em> It's eaiser to control by the users, so the shuttles go exactly where you hit them. Trick shot will be easier to use. </li>
