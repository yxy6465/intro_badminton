            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>a. The background image from the rules.html and professionals.html are filtered a bit with photoshop to allow them fit with the contents.</p>
            <p>b. Two embedded media of Youtube Video were used on the site, one video containing some excited rallys of games is to support the home page to tell the audience why badminton is entertaining. The other video containing the introduction of different types of game in rules.html is the supplement to enrich the rules of badminton.</p>
            <p>c. professionals.html is to introduce legends and players in badminton. All images of players were used CSS image rolloever effect. When the mouse pointer hover on the image of players, one extra image of the players in game will be displayed.</p>
            <p>d. For extra work, I didn't use javasript in this project. Instead, I use some GIF animation to enrich and support my contents. Also, nested grid was used. Diffrent kinds of media queries were created to support the best view of web page. The nested grid will be manipulated in different size of screen. A print stylesheet was created to use serif font while printing it out.</p>
            
            <p>I personally think that I did an A-level work. First of all, the website has a nice color scheme, the home page background is similar to the badminton court so it makes my audience feel familiar. The references page I use the pure white color of background in order to make a professional look of references table. The background images from the rest of the pages have a suitable color so that the text of contents can be read easily. Secondly, the layout of the content followed the CRAP principles well, and the media sources are relative and supportive to different sections of contents. Also, I created different grid style to enhance the level of the page. Media queries support different view of page in different size of screens. </p>
            <p>However, the website is not perfect. I think that the pages are still not comfortable enough in view compared to other big website. One might be the use of font color and style. I use the unusual color(green) which might make the website looks unprofessional. The other reason can be the line spacing and organization between sections. Hopefully I can get a good feedback and improve it later. All references and media are cited at the next section.</p>
